### Disclaimer

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, we provide the work (and each contributor provides its contributions) on an **"AS IS" BASIS**, **WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND**, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of **TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.**

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any contributor be liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, loss of coins, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

**BOTH, THE LEGACY-CLIENT AND THE NEW COMPUTATION-ENABLED CLIENT ARE OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE RUNNING ON THE MAIN-NET BUT ARE STILL CONSIDERED "BETA" AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, SOME OF WHICH MAY HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.**

### Legacy Core Client

The old legacy client should be used by all those who do not plan to get involved in either buying computational resources or by contributing their computational resources to the network. While still in experimental stage, this client is tested for quite a while now and is the safer choice:

### Experimental Beta Client (With Computation)

This is the new client. It allows you to interact with XEL's computation engine on the mainnet. It is less tested and may contain bugs. Please re-read the above disclaimer and never use more coins with it (or with Xeline) than you can afford to lose.

For an easier set-up, we strongly suggest that you use the Docker-based installation found here:
